## ðŸ“Œ Executive Summary

The **Library Management System** project was developed to simulate and manage the daily operations of a typical library using SQL. This end-to-end solution involved designing the database schema, implementing CRUD operations, and performing complex SQL queries for data analysis and reporting. Through this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of relational databases and sharpened my skills in writing efficient and scalable SQL code.

### âœ… What I Learned:

- **Database Design & Normalization:** Created an efficient schema including multiple interrelated tables such as `books`, `members`, `employees`, `branches`, `issued_status`, and `return_status`, ensuring data integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.
- **SQL Proficiency:** Strengthened my command over SQL by performing real-world tasks such as data insertion, updates, deletions, and retrievals.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Applied advanced SQL operations like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, subqueries, and conditional aggregation to generate meaningful insights and reports.
- **CTAS (Create Table As Select):** Leveraged CTAS to dynamically build summary tables for performance and business reporting.
- **Stored Procedures:** Developed reusable and maintainable logic using `PL/pgSQL` stored procedures to automate book issuance and returns, including status updates and exception handling.
- **Data Analysis & Reporting:** Extracted insights like overdue fines, active member trends, branch performance metrics, and top-performing employees based on book issuance.
- **Problem Solving & Optimization:** Identified edge cases such as overdue books and books not returned, and implemented logic to handle such scenarios effectively.

Overall, this project deepened my understanding of database architecture, enhanced my problem-solving skills using SQL, and demonstrated how structured data can be turned into actionable insights in a real-world system.
